    <h3 id="journalSubTitle">Preface</h3> <p id="journalText"> 
        <p>On February 22nd, I turned 25. It was quiet, calm & rewarding. Here are some reflections of a 25 year old.  </p>
        Ever since I was a little boy I had dreams of moving to a city & running my own business. The city over the years has changed, from NY to Boulder, 
        to SF back to NY, Austin, Miami & then Seattle. Before moving, I never told anyone but I had an unbelievable amount of stress. I had little to no money, 
        no job lined up, and got my apartment acceptance a week before my current lease was up. I was leaving my then girlfriend at the time, all my friends, my 
        family, everything I had ever known to drive 3,000 miles to the otherside of the country. I dressed this anxious feeling as excitement. Since having moved 
        I have had quite the adventure. I’ve learned so much about people, how to interact and move within the world and in a sense, became a man. Today, I am single,
         working at an amazing company with one of the greatest mentors a guy can have (Bernie). Ive lusted, explored & took a bunch of shrooms. I still have not founded
          my own company, but rediscovered the beauty of having faith in who you are and where you're at.   

 

<p>In the following I will go over the lessons I learned in the 25 years and hopefully this can help anyone who is out there who may need to read this.  </p>
    </p>




    
    <h4 id="journalChapter">
        If You're Afraid, You Should Probably Do it 
    </h4>
    <p id="journalText">
        Before leaving for Seattle, I had a pretty good life. But it wasn’t great. 
        There were many compromises and this sense that I just needed to get out of 
        there (NJ). This feeling has been with me since I was little. I have always had 
        this sense of feeling like I didn’t belong. Like there was a handbook everyone 
        received at birth that I guess I missed that taught you how to stand, what to do 
        with your hands, how to be just like everybody else. Before leaving I was very excited 
        but I was also so anxious. “What if it doesn’t work out?” “How will people view you if 
        you had to move back?” “What if I lose my girlfriend” “What if I lose sight of who I am?”. 
        These were all the emotions and thoughts running through my head. This is fear speaking. If 
        you know you’ve always wanted something and the time comes to finally do it & you feel yourself 
        pulling back, that means move forward! Before my life changes I always get a sense that maybe it’s a 
        bad idea. Maybe I shouldn’t embark on this journey, maybe its not meant to be. Shut that voice up, tie 
        up those laces & start walking, your journey has just begun.  
    </p>


    <h4 id="journalChapter">
        Be Kind, Not Nice 
    </h4>
    <p id="journalText">
        This move has been an extreme test. I have met people who I thought were my friends who really weren't, 
        as well as people who I thought werent really my friends who turned out to be great people. I have learned that 
        most people, do not in fact have your best interests at heart. I learned this the hard way, having people lie about
         my character to gain an edge in their own lives be it romantically or professionally. Most people are NOT your friends.
          They are humans, always treat them kindly but do not be quick to trust. It takes months – years to truly learn who someone 
          is. I made this mistake, I immediately thought I could trust the people I met when first arriving and it backfired quick.
           Without getting into details it was a huge learning experience for me. Be kind to all you meet, but do not overly extend yourself.  
    </p>
    


    <h4 id="journalChapter">
        Find A Mentor 
    </h4>
    <p id="journalText">
        One of the best things to happen to me recently was getting a B2B sales position at a company and 
        having the most profound experience with the head of the branch Bernie. Bernie is a twice divorced 50 
        something German man. He served in the Navy and is a towering figure well over 6ft, who has taught me 
        so much in the short time I have been with him. When I interviewed with him he had pictures of all his 
        family behind him & told me story after story about his life and the lessons he had learned. But most 
        importantly was the safe space he had in his office. It felt like a sanctuary. He taught me to be confident,
         that things will not always go your way and to lead with pure intentions always. I wont go into detail about 
         all the time we spent drinking and talking about life so long story short, whoever that figure is in your life,
          role models are important. What you consume, who you hang around & what you listen to make you who you are. If you
           want to be at peace, one must consume and do peaceful activities.   
    </p>



    <h4 id="journalChapter">
        Do Not Be Afraid To Start A New Life 
    </h4>
    <p id="journalText">
        Starting over is hard. Getting new friends and setting up a new flow environment is difficult, 
        there is a reason most would rather stay in a toxic environment than do what they know is right and leave. 
        But as the great Tim Dillon once said “Do not be afraid to cancel your friends and family”. If they are holding 
        you back, if they are leeching onto your life force, if they are projecting themselves onto you, it will be impossible 
        to grow. I have recently finished trimming the last of the fat that clung onto me like a drowning victim who would love it if you 
        both were to drown. Looking back, I was miserable. Never truly loved the relationships I had, and have found, your friends and family
         are not always rooting for you. There are people in your life who will follow you because they despise you. What I’ve learned is that 
         most killings come from somebody you know, not the stranger around the corner. In this life you will be backstabbed & betrayed, these 
         actions will come from the people closest to you. I’ve learned to keep a small tight circle, this circle is who I tell my news to. Jordan
          Peterson has another great quote, “Be careful who you tell good news to, also be careful who you tell bad news to”. Many will jump on the
           opportunity to cash in on your fortunes or misfortune. 
    </p>


    <h4 id="journalChapter">
        Be The Hero  
    </h4>
    <p id="journalText">
        I have always grown up wanting to be the hero. What I have come to realize is, I wanted all of the good things of being the hero, 
        being able to make mistakes, acting goofy, being called “The Leader”. What I didn’t understand and and still trying to improve is the 
        responsibility, the commitment, and the power that comes with being the Hero. People in this world are desperatley looking for someone to save 
        them, the lonley girl at the bar or the kid behind the Spruce counter is dying to have a real connection with someone. Be that guy, be the guy 
        who can walk into a room and brighten it up with the pure energy radiating from your soul. Save the girl, she wants a strong confident leader. Not 
        a boy. Be that person. The only thing that feels better than sex (lol) is leading that woman into a new life where she feels safe and comfortable 
        enough to start a family with you. That is a true measure of a hero. To more embody this persona I have lived my life like a video game character,
         I act as though my life is an RPG and that I am the hero. I’m not taking pepto bismol for my stomach ache, Im drinking a magic potion to cure my bowl 
         ills. I am not going to the bar to grab drinks, I am heading to the tavern to socialize with the locals and gain new insights into the community. 
         Obviously don’t take this too seriously, but it helps you drop your fears and become the person you know to be. Do not be afraid to stand up for what
          you believe is right and just. You may face a setback in the moment, but keep the larger picture in focus and a pure heart and you cannot lose. Shes 
          waiting for you... be the hero she deserves. 

 
    </p>


    <h4 id="journalChapter">
        Assumptions 
    </h4>
    <p id="journalText">
        When on your journey, you may not have what is called “social proofs”. Social proofs usually come in the form of other people that can 
        attest to your deads around the world. This can be friends, family, a following count on social media or even a google article. Social proofs
         of your work is important, but do not be afraid to not have this when on your journey. I have traveled to many different places, have had great 
         experiences and live a pretty fun life, I don’t publish many of my adventures though. So people at first glance, especially because of social media 
         cant get a read on me. But they can feel it, the true power is overcoming the need for social proofs and having those around you sense that there is
          more to you than what they can see. I have had many assumpitons made about my life, Ive had people think I was rich or poor, gay or straight, having 
          loads of sex or being celibate. The truth is, these are all projections from their own lives. The people closest to you will know the truth about who
           you are, everyone else, let them make stuff up. Gives them something to talk about.

 
    </p>



    <h4 id="journalChapter">
        If You Don’t Want To Be Like Everyone Else, Stop Doing What Everyone Else Does 
    </h4>
    <p id="journalText">
        Ive always had this dream of being the eccentric trillionaire. The guy who can wear whatever he wants, travels to exotic locations, has multiple properties around 
        the world and answers to no one, but the burning desires of his soul. What they don’t show you is the years of lonliness, being misunderstood and the doubt that will 
        creep in when you are still becoming that person. If you have a vison, be confident and have a little faith it will all work out. The hard days you will one day look 
        back on and realize it was all apart of the story. I will end this with a quote by Steve Jobs, “You cant connect the dots looking forward. You can only connect them looking 
        backwards. So you have to trust that the dots will somehow connect in the future.  

 
    </p>



    <h4 id="journalChapter">
        Epilouge
    </h4>
    <p id="journalText">
        I will end this essay here. But will pick it back up someday to add onto what I have already learned.
         It will be fun to look back on this at 30 and see how my life has progressed since. Remember that time waits
          for nobody. Clear your head, keep your energy focused, intentions pure & I promise you will find what you are looking for.
